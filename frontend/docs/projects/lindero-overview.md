# Lindero — Feasibility Assignment for Developors & Architects

## Context

Lindero was requested by Chris, an architect and firm owner, to streamline early-stage client intake and site feasibility analysis prior to the first consultation.

## Problem

When potential clients book a consultation, Chris must manually gather and analyze property data across multiple tools:

-   Zoning and land-use interpretation via ChatGPT
-   Property and asset data via Zola

This workflow is:

-   Fragmented across tools
-   Time-consuming per client
-   Difficult to standardize
-   Hard to reuse or reference later

There is no single source of truth for early feasibility analysis.

## Proposed Solution

Lindero is a client-intake and asset-analysis tool for developers & architects that automatically generates a property feasibility snapshot using only a client's address.

The goal is to provide clear, architect-friendly insight before the first meeting.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Client Intake & Data Pull

Client submits basic signup information on Chris's website, including property address

Lindero uses the address to automatically pull:

-   Lot details
-   Zoning classification
-   Building lot information
-   Land-use designation

### Step 2: Feasibility & Use Analysis

Using zoning and land-use codes, Lindero identifies:

-   What is allowed vs. restricted on the property
-   Feasible use cases, such as:
    -   Building on currently unused land
    -   Converting single-family → multi-residential
    -   Converting multi-residential → single-family

Lindero outputs a clear, structured feasibility summary that Chris can reference during the first client conversation.

## Current Workaround

Today, Chris manually:

-   Queries ChatGPT for zoning interpretation
-   Uses Zola for property and asset data

Information lives in multiple places with no unified workflow or persistent record.

## Goal

-   Centralize client asset data and zoning feasibility into a single system
-   Reduce time spent on early-stage analysis
-   Improve consistency and repeatability
-   Enable higher-quality, more confident first client conversations
